# glTF import fixtures

`blender_external_skeleton.glb` was generated with the official Blender 4.3 glTF 2.0 exporter from procedural geometry and a two-bone armature created specifically for this repository. It contains no third-party source asset and no `//skeleton//` marker.

`external_mesh_attributes.gltf` is a hand-authored standard glTF 2.0 unindexed triangle strip with eight carried skin influences, no normals, tangents, or UVs, plus unsupported vertex color and morph-target attributes.

`vertex_limit.gltf` is a compact standard glTF 2.0 scene whose shared primitive is instanced twice and exceeds the RMV2 per-segment vertex limit without embedding a large binary buffer.

The PBR import tests generate small standard OPAQUE GLB and `.gltf` fixtures at runtime from procedural triangles and solid-color images. They cover embedded and relative external images, base color, normal, metallic-roughness, equivalent decoded-image deduplication, and missing-image failure without carrying third-party assets.

All fixtures were created specifically for this repository and are dedicated to the public domain under CC0-1.0: <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>.
